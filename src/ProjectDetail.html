<h3>2. About the organisation</h3>
  <p>The Green Foundation was founded in August 2005 and is a non-profit organisation that aims to
assist and uplift rural communities with the support of environmental projects. We have raised
more than R 4 million to date and have won the Hope Award in 2007 and 2010. To date, we have
assisted 45 rural communities in South Africa, Botswana and Zambia and planted more than
30,000 trees. For a full outline of our projects per area, please see our project booklet, attached. </p> 
 <p>Our staff currently includes two full time project coordinators, a marketing coordinator and five
administrative staff members. We also have four part time volunteers during various stages of
the year.  </p> 
 <p>Our main message is that poverty and environmental degradation are intrinsically linked. By
educating communities to respect the environment, opportunities for income generation are
created.   </p> 
</div>

<h3>3. Target audience</h3>
  <p><b>a. The general public.</b> 75% of our funding comes fro a. The general public m individuals who hear about our message
through our marketing channels. The remainder comes from corporate sponsorship and
internal profit generation (such as fundraising activities and sale of our branded merchandise).  </p> 
 <p><b>b. Businesses.</b> Businesses contribute 15% to our fun b. Businesses. ding. We would like to strengthen our focus
on corporate sponsorship during 2011 and use the website to support co-branded sponsorship
projects like the SASA green campaign. </p> 
 <p><b>c. Volunteering students. </b> Once a year we run a volu c. Volunteering students nteer program in conjunction with Rand
University. Social studies students donate 100 hours of their time to an NGO of their choice as
part of their year-end thesis. We typically receive 500 hours donated each year. The website
should act as a recruitment drive for these volunteers, as well as other non-student volunteers.  </p> 
 <p><b>h. Design students. </b> We sell branded merchandise (t- h. Design students. shirts, caps and bags) in our online shop
as part of our fundraising. The designs and illustrations are donated by designers and design
students. We would like the site to attract further contributions in this area. An online
competition platform would be ideal.  </p>

<h3>4. Project objectives</h3>
<p>This ties in with our major website objectives: </p>
<ul><li>Create awareness about our organisation </li>
<li>Generate donations and merchandise sales</li>
<li>Build an online community</li>
<li>Build a repository for resources and materials on &quot;going green&quot;</li>

</ul>

<div class="element" style="margin-bottom:0">
<h3>5. Design</h3>
<p>The design should be clean and ‘organic-looking’. We are leaning towards green as the dominant hue together with neutral colours like beige and grey. We would like to feature a mixture of object and people-based photography. A disk with project photos will be supplied
but stock photography may need to be sourced where there are gaps.</p>
<p>The home page design should tie in with our main message, which is:</p>
<p>Where people photography is concerned, a mixture of races and ages should be represented.</p></div>
